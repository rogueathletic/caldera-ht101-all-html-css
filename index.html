        There are a lot of things you need to know before buying a hot tub — it can make the process feel overwhelming. Going through a checklist of considerations and prioritizing what you want most will help you find the perfect one for you (and your wallet).
    </p>
    <p>
        
        To simplify the decision-making process, we broke it down into three categories of what you need to know before buying a hot tub:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            How much do you want to spend?
        </li>
        <li>
            What size will work best with your space and budget?
        </li>
        <li>
            Why are you buying a hot tub?
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        How much should I spend?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        A hot tub can cost as little as $3,000 or more than $15,000. And like most items, the higher in price you go, the more luxurious of a hot tub you’ll get. More expensive hot tubs can include the latest technologies, highest quality materials and unique additions like lighting and water features.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Ultimately, quality is key because though you may pay more upfront, with a quality hot tub, you’ll save on maintenance fees and headaches in the future. For more pricing insights, watch our video, <a href="/video/how-much-does-a-hot-tub-cost" title="How much does a hot tub cost? - Video Link">“How much does a hot tub cost?”</a>
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Here’s what to look for in a durable, high-quality hot tub:
    </h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Look for higher density foam materials for stronger insulation
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Consider water care systems like the <a href="/hot-tub-accessories/water-care/freshwater-salt-system" title="learn more about the Fresh Water Salt System">FreshWater<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt System</a> that require minimal effort to keep water fresh and clean
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Credible <a href="/find-dealer" title="link to dealers">dealers</a> will offer a manufacturer’s <a href="/owners-corner/warranty" title="Manufacture Waranty Info">warranty</a> and offer services to keep your tub at peak performance throughout its lifespan
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
        Additional factors to consider when purchasing a hot tub
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        To get the most out of your new hot tub, you’ll need to think about more than just the spa itself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For starters, your space will need a hard, flat surface that can steadily hold the weight of the tub. Will you need to build a new platform or get a concrete pad? Remember to consider installation. For example, a hot tub on a rooftop or second-story deck may need a crane to lift it into place. So, make sure the space surrounding your home can accommodate any unique installation needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Hot tub accessories such as stairs and a cover lifter are also important for making your hot tub comfortable and easy to use. You’ll also want to consider the insulation of the hot tub. If you choose a brand with a lack of insulation, you may have higher monthly energy bills. It's important to know what sort of insulation the spa uses so you won't be surprised when your first electric bill arrives. For example, Caldera Spas uses an insulation called FiberCor that has <a href="/hot-tub-tips/energy-efficient-caldera-spas-leave-your-money-your-pocket">four times the density of urethane foam</a> found in most other hot tub brands.

    </p>
    
    <h2>
        What size hot tub should I choose?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Choosing the right sized hot tub will help you maximize your hot tub experience and use. To start, measure the size of the space to have a sense of what dimensions will work well. Be sure to consider how much walking room you’ll give to the hot tub and how you can access the cabinet area for maintenance when measuring.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Number of Seats
    </h3>
    <p>
        It’s important to consider who will be using the hot tub regularly.  In order to give everyone the full experience of the therapeutic jets and massages, it is best if each person has a seat. You may want to consider purchasing a tub with more seats for other friends and family. The 7-seat <a href="/shop/paradise/salina-hot-tub">Salina</a> spa featuring 40 jets and a spacious two level footwell is perfect for group soaks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not all hot tub seats are created equal. Some hot tubs have reclining lounge seats as well as traditional seats. If you plan on using the hot tub for yourself and one other person for relaxation, don’t miss out on getting these soothing lounge seats.

    <h2>
        What am I going to use a hot tub for?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Adding a hot tub to your home can improve your lifestyle in any number of ways. So, what motivated you to want to buy a hot tub? Was it to help with pain relief? Improve your sleep? Help with rest and relaxation? Or do you simply want to spend more time with your family? Whatever your motivation, if you take the time to research the right model, a hot tub can be a positive addition to your life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here are common reasons why people purchase a hot tub and what features to consider for each.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Relaxation and stress relief
    </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>A hot tub is the ultimate method of self-care</strong>
        because once you have it, it’s always there waiting for you. No need to drive to the gym or call your friend to use theirs.</p>
    <p>
        If your main purpose of buying a hot tub is to de-stress, focus on shopping for a tub with the <a href="/hot-tub-tips/important-know-about-hot-tub-jets">best jet placement and power level you desire</a>. That can make all the difference depending on where you hold the most tension and how sensitive your body may be to jets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4049052/" target="_blank" title="External Link: Cited source National Library of Medicine">Studies</a> have shown that your <strong> blood pressure drops by 11-12% and your heart rate lowers by 15%</strong> after immersing yourself in the warm water of a hot tub. Tension is released throughout your body as your muscles loosen up, calming your entire body. Feeling relaxed already?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For health and wellness-minded people, a hot tub is the perfect place to practice mindfulness and meditation while reaping physical benefits. It’s the perfect way to achieve a mind-body balance and get through stressful times with ease.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Recovery after intense workouts or activities
    </h3>
    
    <p>Are you or someone in your household extremely active and prone to muscle injuries or feeling sore ALL the time? Powerful jets will relax muscles, ligaments and tendons and stimulate the release of endorphins, the body’s natural pain reliever.</p>
    <p>
        Overall, the heat from the hot tub will <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com//uk/training/a776522/hot-bath-or-ice-bath-which-is-best-for-recovery/">improve blood circulation</a>, helping your muscles recover so you can continue working out and doing the activities you love most.

    <h3>
        Recreation and socializing
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        If you love inviting people over or are looking for a new activity for your whole family, a hot tub is a great way to encourage socialization and turn your house into the desired hot spot (literally). Spending quality time in a hot tub can help you open up more, leading to better conversations and better connections with the important people in your life.
    </p>
    
    <p>

        </li>
